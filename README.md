# EconomyPluginRM-Minecraft-1.20.1
A small minecraft plugin made for small server with friends. It adds shops, private chest, virtual market, small logs and physical shops

After testing it with friends, i forgot you could enchant items... (I'm not a big minecraft player...). So when creating shops don't try to put enchanted items... it's only going to sell the item...

Everything is explained in the pdf in main branch ;)
